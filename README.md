# Restful plugin for CakePHP3 IcingCMS

Restful will turn your IcingCMS into an API. The API uses the UserManager plugin and JWT for token.

## Installation

Go to your site.com/admin
Click on IcingManger >> add New Plugins >> look for Restful >> click install. That is it.
Go trough this [tutorial](http://www.bravo-kernel.com/2015/04/how-to-build-a-cakephp-3-rest-api-in-minutes/) to understand how this plugin works.

This plugin uses [FriendsOfCake Crude](https://github.com/FriendsOfCake/crud) and [cakephp-jwt-auth](https://github.com/ADmad/cakephp-jwt-auth)
